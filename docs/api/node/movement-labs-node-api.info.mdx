## APIs

The Movement Network can be accessed by several API endpoints. 

:::info

This APi documentation in its current form is only referring to the Aptos (Suzuka) environment

:::

## Movement Fullnode

This API - embedded into Fullnodes - provides a simple, low latency, yet low-level way of reading state and submitting transactions to the Movement Blockchain. It also supports transaction simulation.

## Indexer API

The Indexer is an API you can use to retrive Aggregate data, Historical data, and Data that might be hard to get from the simpler FullNode API. 

Learn more about it [here](/devs/indexing).
