# Movement CLI

Movement CLI supports Aptos Move natively. Here are the instructions to install and use Movement CLI:

## Install Movement CLI

:::tip

When developing on Movement, it is recommended to use the `movement` CLI, or `aptos` CLI  version â‰¤ 3.5.0

    ### Options 1 - Binary Install
    1. `git clone https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core/ && cd aptos-core`

    2. `cargo build -p movement` (generates the `target/debug/movement` executable)

    3. Copy `movement` into your `bin` or add it to your `PATH` depending on your system config.

    For example, to copy `movement` to `bin` on Mac or Linux:

    ```
    sudo cp target/debug/movement /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    ### Options 2 - Install through Brew
    - Make sure you have `homebrew` installed
    - If not, you need to install through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or you can install it by:

    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    - Install Aptos CLI
    ```
    brew install aptos
    ```

## Use Movement CLI

Movement CLI commands are analogous to those of Aptos CLI. Simply replace `aptos` with `movement`.

So `aptos move build` becomes `movement move build`.

For help within the CLI tool:

```
movement --help
```

or

```
movement <subcommand> --help
```
