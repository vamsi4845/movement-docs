# Getting Started

Welcome to the Movement Network! This guide will help you start building on our blockchain quickly and efficiently. Whether you're a developer familiar with Aptos, EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), or Sui ecosystems, we've got you covered.

## Choose Your Environment

The Movement Network currently supports three development environments:

1. **Aptos Environment** (Suzuka Testnet)
2. **MEVM Environment** (Imola Testnet)
3. **Sui Environment** (Sui Imola Testnet)

Select the environment that aligns with your preferred programming language or ecosystem.

## Testnet Startup

If you are new to the ecosystem check out the [Your First Move Module](/devs/firstmove) guide which will guide you through the process of building your very first Move Module or Contract. 

## Aptos Environment

### Get Started

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

   - **Option 1:** Install the [Movement CLI](/devs/movementcli) to scaffold your project effortlessly.
   - **Option 2:** If you're already familiar with Aptos, you can continue using the [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli#-install-the-aptos-cli).

2. **Access Network Endpoints**

   - Obtain the necessary endpoints from our [Network Endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints#aptos-environment) section to connect to the **Suzuka Testnet**.

3. **Learn and Build**

   - Dive into our [Aptos Tutorials](/devs/tutorials/Deploy/aptosmodule) to start deploying your first modules.

## MEVM Environment

### Get Started

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

   - Visit our section for [Ethereum Developers](/category/evm-contracts) for tools and resources tailored to Solidity development.

2. **Access Network Endpoints**

   - Get the necessary endpoints from our [Network Endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints#evm-environment) section to connect to the **Imola Testnet**.

3. **Learn and Build**

   - Utilize your favorite Solidity tools to start building and deploying smart contracts.

## Sui Environment

### Get Started

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

   - Explore our section for [Sui Developers](/devs/tutorials/Deploy/suimodule) for guidance on setting up your Sui Move environment.

2. **Access Network Endpoints**

   - Retrieve the necessary endpoints from our [Network Endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints#sui-environment) section to connect to the **Sui Imola Testnet**.

3. **Learn and Build**

   - Begin with our Sui tutorials to deploy your first modules and interact with the network.

## Obtain Testnet Tokens

Before deploying contracts or performing transactions, you'll need testnet tokens:

- Visit our [Faucets](/general/UsingMovement/faucet) page to request tokens for your chosen environment.
